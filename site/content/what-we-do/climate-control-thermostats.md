                <h3>Your thermostat controls half your energy bill - more than appliances, more than electronics. So shouldn't it help you save energy?</h3>
                    <img src="/images/sections/climate-control-thermostats/nest-01.png" style="float:left; margin:10px;" alt="" />
                    <p class="content">The 3rd gen Nest Thermostat gets to know the temperature you like when you’re home. And turns itself down when you’re away. It even learns how your home heats or cools, so it only uses the energy it needs. That helps save energy. Since 2011, the Nest Thermostat has saved over 4 billion kWh of energy in millions of homes worldwide.</p>
                <h3>It lights up when you walk in the room</h3>
                    <p class="content">Now the Nest Thermostat does something new. It’s called Farsight and it lights up to show you the temperature you’ve set or the time. You can even choose a digital or analog clock face. Farsight is big and bright on the beautiful display – you can see it from across the room.</p>
                <h3>Your life with Nest</h3>
                    <p class="content">The Nest Learning Thermostat automatically adapts as your life and the seasons change. Just use it for a week and it programs itself.</p>
                <h3>Know your home is safe</h3>
                    <p class="content">The Nest Thermostat is just one part of your heating and cooling system. But it can keep an eye on the rest of it. You’ll get an alert on your phone if there’s something wrong – like temperatures are so low your pipes could burst. And if it looks like your furnace is acting up, the Nest Thermostat will send you an alert.</p>
